      #### Disclaimer
      The core XPU_GRAPH team is small and has very limited capacity. We may not have time to look into your report.
      For the best results, please:
        - Avoid submitting duplicates. Search through [the existing and past issues](https://github.com/BD-Seed-HHW/xpu_graph/issues?q=is%3Aissue) first to see if it's been reported previously.
        - Check if the issue persists with a build from the latest source.
        - Provide all relevant information in the initial report, to prevent unnecessary back and forth discussion.
        - If you can, try to diagnose and/or fix the issue yourself. We welcome high quality contributions.
